Information about response codes for security violations is provided in the Adabas Security documentation.\n- When a new user issues an OP command with the same user ID (in ADD1) as an earlier user did and the earlier user was inactive for more than 60 seconds, the new user can, by issuing a second OP cmd again (the first OP cmd will get response code 9, sub-code 64), take over the user ID of the earlier user. When the earlier user becomes active again, this sub-code can be received.\n
ADAGE0900F=The user was backed out because a pending Work area overflow occurred during this operation.
ADAGE09011=At the end of an online recovery process that was initiated after the failure of a peer nucleus in an Adabas cluster, the nucleus was unable to re-acquire the ETID specified by the user in the Additions 1 field of the OP command.

ADAGE09013=The user's active command was interrupted and stopped because a peer nucleus in an Adabas cluster terminated abnormally. If the interrupted command was using a command ID (CID), the command ID is deleted.
ADAGE09014=The Adabas cluster nucleus assigned to the user terminated while the user had an open transaction. The transaction has been or will be backed out.
ADAGE09015=The user's active command was waiting for an ISN in hold status when the user was backed out and closed due to a timeout or a STOP command.
ADAGE09016=The user's active command was waiting for free space in the work pool when the user was backed out and closed due to a timeout or a STOP command.
ADAGE0903E=An OP (open) command was issued without a user/ET ID, which is required for this type of application or environment.
ADAGE0903F=An OP command was given for an ET user not in ET status. The user is backed out with an Adabas-generated BT command, and the operation is closed.
ADAGE09040=An OP command was issued with an 8-byte ET ID that already existed.
ADAGE09042=An Adabas session with OPENRQ=YES was active and the user issued an Adabas command without having issued an OP command.
ADAGE09043=Insufficient Work part 1 space for open command with ETID definition when trying to read the user profile.
ADAGE09044=The user queue element has been deleted. Most likely the command was thrown back due to ISN contention or space shortage. The space shortage is normally work-pool space; if this is the case, the LWP parameter setting should be increased.
ADAGE09046=These sub-codes are given only when Adabas Transaction Manager is in use. Review the Adabas Transaction Manager documentation for more information.

When running with ADARUN DTP={RM | TM}, an attempt was made by a non-Adabas Transaction Manager user to access/update an Adabas Transaction Manager system file.
ADAGE11005=The file is either not loaded, or has been locked by another user for privileged use. On mainframe systems, for ADAORD and ADAINV utility operations, the write phase has started and use of the file is now blocked for the type of operation you requested.
ADAGE11006=An E1 (delete record) command was given without specifying a valid file number.

ADAGE11010=On mainframe systems, an attempt was made to perform an update (e.g. A1, E1, N1/2) against a file loaded with the attribute RPLUPDATEONLY=YES. On open systems, the file was locked by ADAOPR.
ADAGE11011=An attempt was made to perform an update (e.g. A1, E1, N1/2) against a file loaded with the attribute READONLY=YES.
ADAGE11012=File has been locked with ALOCKF.
ADAGE11015=On mainframe systems, there was not enough space for encoding elements (ECSE). On open systems, a two-byte file number was used against a lower version database that does not support large file numbers.
